<p><strong>Baltimore Truss Design</strong>, These men along with other bridge builders who followed them designed and built many bridges especially in New England. A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. The disadvantage of building this bridge is its design but the advantage is the bridge being more steady and able to withstand more force.</p>

The difference between Pratt truss and Baltimore truss is that the latter is strengthened by providing additional support in the lower section. Through our experiment it was found that the bridge design that minimized the maximum compression force was the Howe Bridge. Truss Design Warren Pratt Howe K-Truss. Truss bridge is the strongest yet uses the least amount of material. The Baltimore truss is a sub-type of the Pratt truss but differs by the addition of half-length struts or ties in the top bottom or both parts of the panels.</p>
