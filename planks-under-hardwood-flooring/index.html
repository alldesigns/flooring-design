<p>Usually manufactured in 4-by-8-foot sheets plywood panels and OSB are acceptable subfloors for hardwood flooring as long as they are the proper thickness. Most hardwood floors consist of many individual planks or boards measuring differing lengths but having the same width. How you arrange these planks in size is up to you and the result has little effect on the functionality of the floor. The veneer is a slice of wood usually about a 18-inch 318 mm thick glued to the plywood base.

They can make the veneer from almost any species providing a wide array of colors and looks for any décor. Hardwood flooring will contain a mix of cleaner planks as well as character planks. 38 Enchanting Wide Plank Hardwood Floors 38 Enchanting Wide Plank Hardwood Flo White Oak Hardwood Floors Wood Floors Wide Plank Wide Plank Hardwood Floors.</p>
