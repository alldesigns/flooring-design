<p>The Architecture and Engineering team will continue to advance the physical requirements and building component relationships. As architects we rely on multiple design phases in our projects to ensure a smooth schedule and workflow for everyone on the project team. However an additional phase called programming or pre-design is often available as an add-on service. These definitions establish a common vocabulary to assist in the design and construction of low to zero carbon buildings and beyond.</p>
