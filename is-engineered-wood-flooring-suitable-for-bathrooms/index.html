<p>Engineered wood is a more cost-effective option. Other types of wooden flooring can also be used but with softer and less dense wood special attention should be paid to the thickness of the floorboards so that they do not act as an insulator blocking heat. Prefinished engineered hardwood floors are much more durable and longer lasting however and are a great option for dog owners who love the warm appeal of wood flooring. This resistance to moisture fluctuation makes it the ideal candidate for laying over an underfloor heating system - increasingly popular in bathrooms.
