<p>As we said wide plank wood flooring starts at six inches but eight-inch and 10-inch widths are also common. They capture the essence of trunk wood flooring well and show off the most natural features of a bespoke wood floor. Wide plank flooring is available in a variety of woods including oak maple bamboo acacia and more. The wider planks means each tree produces fewer planks.
