<p>We can supply almost all of the hardwood and fir finishes you see on this website as wide and extra wide plank 300mm floorboards. Finished with a surface layer of solid wood veneer this modern flooring solution looks identical to traditional hardwood floors. Remember if you go wide youll want to make sure you request long lengths in your floorboards too. The flooring is created from limbs and smaller tree trunks which means the flooring lacks the interesting visual appeal of the plank flooring.
