<p>Our latest customer Corrine wanted to upgrade her Carmel Valley home by removing all of the carpet in the upstairs bedrooms and installing new hardwood flooring including on the stairs. Installed with a deep or memory foam pad downstairs inhabitants will barely know that. It is also not slippery making it an ideal flooring type for an upstairs bathroom if you want to avoid the noise that comes with tiles installed in upstairs rooms. Aug 23 2014 - Is it wrong to have different wooden flooring upstairs from downstairs. Never Thought Of Just Putting Wood In The Hallway And Carpet On Stairs And Bedroom Small Bedroom Remodel Master Bedroom Remodel Kids Bedroom Remodel.</p>
