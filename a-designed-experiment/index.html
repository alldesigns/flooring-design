<p>A designed experiment is a test or series of tests in which purposeful changes are made to the input variables of a process or system so that we may observe and identify the reasons for changes in the output response. For example if you believe that there is an interaction between two variables be sure to include both variables in your design. If you expect that the response will be a nonlinear function of the factors at least 3 levels per factor must be used. A good experimental design requires a strong understanding of the system you are studying. An Open Design Experiment To Create 100 Patterns Experiments Design Pattern.</p>
