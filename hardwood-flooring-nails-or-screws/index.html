<p>Using 2 finish nails and a hammer you can nail down wood flooring boards that are moving and causing squeaks. Flooring nails have a smooth part to allow the wood to move and a serrated part to grip the subfloor. Then use putty or filler to hide the nail hole. It makes sense to me as you say to float the floor on plywood when there are large humidity variations.
