<p>The natural properties of wood also mean that it has a fast heat-up time whilst also resisting heat from escaping too quickly making wood helpful in maximising the energy. We recommend KÃ¤hrs Original 15 mm parquet flooring or KÃ¤hrs Linnea 7 mm with Woodloc or Woodloc 5S joints for floors with underfloor heating. Engineered timber is the best type of wood flooring to use with an underfloor heating system as it performs well with changes in floor temperature.

<p>Engineered Wood Flooring are suitable for underfloor heating provided the overall thickness of the board does not exceed 18mm and the top real wood layer does not exceed 5mm. If using a low tog underfloor heating underlay then the engineered wood flooring can be floated or loose laid. Solid wood flooring is recommended by us acclimatisation period of at least 1 week 18mm thick. The system integrates a flat aluminium foil that barely raises the floor and thats exactly why its perfect for floating floors.

<p>Underfloor heating is suitable for most types of wood flooring. Woodpecker bamboo and laminate floors are compatible with underfloor heating too and also have some of the lowest tog ratings in our collection. A foil heater consists of a thin multi-strand thats fully enclosed with a fibre-reinforced foil in addition to a fluoropolymer-insulated dual-core heating cable. This helps the floorboards do not act as an insulator blocking the heat. Mapei Adesilex Pa Wood Floor Adhesive 16 Kg Wood Floors Flooring Wooden Flooring.</p>
