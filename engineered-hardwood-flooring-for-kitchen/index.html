<p>We expect all of the floors in this category to last at least 20 years even under the high demands of a busy kitchen. Available in a whole host of wood species. If more stability is needed because of the geographical location of the house and the tendency of the humidity to fluctuate engineered wood is probably your best bet to avoid cupping and gapping. Engineered hardwood is generally more stable than its solid counterpart and is more resistant to humidity. Page Title Dream House New Homes House.</p>
