<p>Practical sailor posted a long term test a while back and Epiphanes wood finish gloss came out as one of the most uv resistant as well as having excellent gloss retention. The second product to consider is the Osmo UV Protection Oil Extra if your wood is smooth this could be the best clear product on the market for UV protection. A sealer with a sturdy finish and quality application can definitely protect your wood from moisture but not forever. This transparent stain wont cover over the natural beauty of cedar fences but keep in mind that it is lightly pigmented to provide UV protection.

<p>The degree of UV protection depends on the thickness of the coatings. OneTime is well suited for a variety of outdoor projects ranging from arbors to picnic tables but be sure that you apply the finish outdoors so that the resin gets the sunlight it needs to cure. Nothing blocks UV rays better than pigments. Along with protecting wood it doesnt change its appearance and maintains the natural color.
