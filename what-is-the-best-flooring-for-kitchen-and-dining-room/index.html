<p>In my opinion they are both great options. Light floors look quite nice with white or colored walls. Its an upgrade version of regular ceramic tile because of a manufacturing process that makes it harder and less porous a good choice for kitchens where spills are likely. Tile is also a low-maintenance type of flooring never requiring more than a vacuuming and mopping and itll last a lifetime.
