<p>Heres how to find them. However should you have any concerns or doubts as to how large a gap to leave and how often it should be included when fitting an engineered wood floor always seek expert advice. It is not absolutely necessary to remove baseboards to install new hardwoods but remember that wood floors require an expansion gap of 12 inch along the surrounding walls to accommodate expansion and contraction with changes in moisture and humidity. That will be no concern for movement there although I would still get a small gap minimally an 18 most certainly not tight since the wood does move albeit slightly in its length.
