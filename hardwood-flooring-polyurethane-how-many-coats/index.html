<p>Some finishers offer lower estimates for two coats but your floor wont have the same level of protection and scratches will go through to the wood more easily. I remember the one I got says something about first 3-4 coats only need 8 hours in between oil based but any more coats need to wait significantly longer like a week or so. How many coats of polyurethane should be put on hardwood floors. When applying water-based polyurethane on hardwood floors youll need to apply a minimum of three coats.

<p>Multiple are needed to provide plenty of protectant and keep your wood looking gorgeous. Other brands of 550 voc finish are so watery that even after four coats the floors still look like they could use another coat. You dont NEED any stain at all if you dont want to deepen the natural color of the wood. I also typically apply 3 coats of oil-borne polyurethane.
