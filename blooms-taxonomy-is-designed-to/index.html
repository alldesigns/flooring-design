<p>By creating a hierarchical structure to track a students depth of understanding Bloom created a way to ascertain the ever-elusive question every Educator asks themselves.

What is Blooms Taxonomy. Blooms taxonomy is designed to address three domains of education and learning.</p>
<h3 id="blooms-taxonomy-is-a-classification-system-developed-by-educational-psychologist-benjamin-bloom-to-categorize-cognitive-skills-and-learning-behavior">Blooms Taxonomy is a classification system developed by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom to categorize cognitive skills and learning behavior.</h3><p>Blooms Taxonomy is a classification system developed by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom to categorize cognitive skills and learning behavior. Blooms Taxonomy is a classification of the different objectives and skills that educators set for their students learning objectives. Blooms taxonomy is based on the belief that learners must begin by learning basic foundational knowledge about a given subject before they can progress to more complex types of thinking such as analysis and evaluation. The matrix organization of the revised version of Blooms taxonomy is designed to be a more precise form of thinking about learning making it easier for educators to create clear objectives for lesson planning and student evaluation. The terminology has been recently updated to include the following six levels of learning. Specific learning outcomes can be derived from the taxonomy though it is most commonly used to assess learning on a variety of cognitive levels.</p>
