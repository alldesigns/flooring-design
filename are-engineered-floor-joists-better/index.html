However if a deeper joist is used on a bigger span the joist price will reduce against a shallow depth as the depth allows the joist to work with smaller timbers and less metal webs.</p>
<h3 id="engineered-wood-products-have-pushed-the-design-boundaries-to-lengths-that-seemed-unachievable-a-few-short-years-ago">Engineered wood products have pushed the design boundaries to lengths that seemed unachievable a few short years ago.</h3><p>An engineered wood joist more commonly known as an I-joist is a product designed to eliminate problems that occur with conventional wood joists.
