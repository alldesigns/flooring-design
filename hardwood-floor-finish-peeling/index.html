Theyre mostly holding up pretty well but around our breakfast bar the stools have taken up some of the varathane and have left damaged scuffed and peeling spots. When I say a few Ive got about eight pieces where the corners are starting to peel up and then about two pieces where the actual side is starting to peel up.</p>
