There are pros and cons to both hardwood and tile in the kitchen but personally I prefer hardwood not only for the reasons you gave but also because its easier on feet warmer and easier to clean. I have 12 years experience with a flooring wholesale company and I think tile are better just for durability alone. Porcelain Wood Tile Porcelain Wood Tile Wood Grain Tile Home Remodeling.</p>
