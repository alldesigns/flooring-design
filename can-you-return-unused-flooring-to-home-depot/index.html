<h3 id="returns-or-exchanges-are-not-permitted-on-opened-boxes-special-or-custom-orders-close-outs-and-odd-lots">Returns or exchanges are not permitted on opened boxes special or custom orders close-outs and odd lots.</h3><p>Appliances are not returnable for Buyers Remorse and had to be refused at delivery. But there are exceptions. For stores where all lumber is stored inside the main building like Home Depot its a simple matter of checking in at the customer service desk or contractors desk with the items you want to return. Home Depot will not come to pick up returns. Homeowners and businesses depend on us for urgent needs such as hot water heaters refrigerators electrical and plumbing repairs and harsh weather items like tarps. So they dont sell them in store for you to look at and you cant return them once you see them in person even if it was not installed yet.</p>
