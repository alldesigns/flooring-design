<p>You can test if the finish layer is still intact by dropping a small amount of water on it and waiting to see if the water beads up or is absorbed into the wood. But thats probably because we are empty nesters living in a dry climate where the floors are not exposed to continuous moisture. While the protective layer of a sealant may be able to delay it for a bit it will eventually grow between as well as beneath the boards. Since the bathroom is the most humid room in the house youll want to go with a floor that is known for its water resistance and dimensional stability.

<p>Sorry my good buddy Cancork but Ive said before that I think wood floors in bathrooms are okay. Extra care should be taken during installment. Hardwood floor in 18sf half bath - bad idea. I have a half bath off of my foyer that I was going to put hardwood in as well since it would flow very nicely.
