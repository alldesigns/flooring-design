<p>There are plenty of flooring options that work well with underfloor heating but if you want a wood floor combined with floor heating then engineered wood flooring is the best option. Finally if you are using underfloor heating alongside wooden flooring you will need to make sure it covers the entire floor. You can go for engineered hardwoods that typically present with a ply substrate However they typically come with a long list of dos and donts and typically most underfloor. The underfloor heating system should be switched off during the installation of the wooden flooring.
