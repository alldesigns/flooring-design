<p>It ended up being a little more difficult than normal since we planned on installing hardwood flooring on stairs with an existing nosing but I found an easy solution. Our Stair Department can expertly transition your carpeted stairway to beautiful hardwood Treads and Risers in just days. Also treads are made from a high grade. We can match the color of your new hardwood steps to your existing floor and seamlessly blend your new staircase into your home décor. Epingle Sur Staircase Ideas.</p>
