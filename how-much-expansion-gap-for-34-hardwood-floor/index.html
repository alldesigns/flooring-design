<p>Solid hardwoods by far will expand and contract more than engineered products. Wood floors require an expansion gap of 12 inch along the surrounding walls to accommodate expansion and contraction with changes in moisture and humidity. Others that are wide enough for dimes. Yes all types of wooden flooring need an expansion gap in order to expand and contract naturally with changes in their surroundings.

How much will depend on the layout involved seasonal change in relative humidity species selection and type of hardwood cut.
