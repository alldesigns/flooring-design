<p>In most cases site finished hardwood ends up looking and feeling warmer than pre-finished floors. We love to aid in the decision making process when it comes to. But when you purchase un-finished flooring and have it finished on-site you get the added bonus of seeing the finish applied to your flooring and added reassurance that it was done right. Please tell me in your honest opinion if finishing a hardwood floor onsite is better than a pre-finished floor I thought a pre-finished floor was more durable with the oxide finish.
