<p>I used a 15g pneumatic finish nailer on the starting row but I had to return it to the rental place. Nail Down Close to a Wall. For the last 3 or 4 rows where the finish nailer wont fit you can drill through the tongues and hand nail. Make a hole through the face of the flooring plank about 3 inches from the end of the plank and about 14 inch in from the edge of the plank that will lie closest to the wall. 16 Gauge Manual Hardwood Floor Ratcheting Surface Nailer Nailer Hardwood Floors Gauges.</p>

<p>But it may not penetrate well through a dense ¾ solid hardwood flooring. Im unable to use the floor stapler anymore because it wont fit. Then hold nailer at 45 degree angle to floor shoot into tongue of flooring every 4-6 inches repeat process until back of nailer almost touches wall. For best results you should use a flooring nailer that will give sufficient grip to your panels. Pin On Parquet Flooring.</p>
